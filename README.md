# PowerShell Utilities
## FileSorter
This script will sort files in a directory into folders based on their file extension. It will create a folder for each unique file extension and move all files with that extension into the folder. It will also create a folder for files with no extension.

### Usage
```powershell
.\FileSorter.ps1 -Path "C:\Path\To\Directory"
```
